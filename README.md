# Transportation generative tool for highway removal

## Overview
This is an in-process generative design project in graduate school to help urban planners explore alternative motorway networks after removing highways that have been considered societal problems and have been understudied in many cities.

In this program coded by Python, GIS data are analyzed by Geopandas and NetworkX, a python library specialized in network analysis. [Here](https://kuwaharashinichiro.com/highwayremoval.html) is a link to the project page on my portfolio website.
